This repository provides a map with the coordinates of the vegetation
plots contributed by different partners to project **SynTreeSys**, based
on the last stable version of the dataset. More information on the
project can be found
[here](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/syntreesys/).

### How to visualize the map

To open the map just click on the following link:

Three visualization options are provided with the plot coordinates,
which are provided by [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/),
[Esri World
Imagery](https://www.esri.com/en-us/capabilities/imagery-remote-sensing/capabilities/content)
and [OpenTopoMap](https://opentopomap.org/).
