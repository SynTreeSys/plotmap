This repository provides a map with the coordinates of the vegetation
plots contributed by different partners to project **SynTreeSys**, based
on the last stable version of the dataset. More information on the
project can be found

Only the coarse plot coordinates and the respective network are provided
due to third party restictions on plot metadata.
