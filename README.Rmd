# An open map of the location of SynTreeSys plots


<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


This repository provides a map with the coordinates of the vegetation plots
contributed by different partners to project **SynTreeSys**, based on the
last stable version of the dataset. More information on the project can be found
[here](https://www.fondationbiodiversite.fr/en/the-frb-in-action/programs-and-projects/le-cesab/syntreesys/).

<br>

### How to visualize the map

To open the map just click on the following link: https://syntreesys.github.io/plotmap/

Three visualization options are provided with the plot coordinates, which are provided by [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/), [Esri World Imagery](https://www.esri.com/en-us/capabilities/imagery-remote-sensing/capabilities/content) and [OpenTopoMap](https://opentopomap.org/).

##### Note

Only the coarse plot coordinates and the respective network are provided due to
third-party restrictions on plot metadata.
